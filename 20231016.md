### HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Zero-Day Vulnerability Exploited to Launch Record DDoS Attacks

##### Description
Amazon Web Services (AWS), Cloudflare, and Google have taken steps to mitigate record-breaking distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that exploited a novel technique known as HTTP/2 Rapid Reset. These layer 7 attacks, detected in late August 2023, were coordinated under the CVE-2023-44487 designation with a CVSS score of 7.5. The attacks aimed at Google's cloud infrastructure reached 398 million requests per second, while those targeting AWS and Cloudflare exceeded 155 million and 201 million RPS, respectively.

HTTP/2 Rapid Reset exploits a zero-day flaw in the HTTP/2 protocol, allowing DDoS attacks by sending and rapidly canceling requests in quick succession. This technique overwhelms the server without reaching its configured threshold, effectively taking down websites. Notably, these attacks can be executed using a relatively small botnet, such as 20,000 machines, as observed by Cloudflare.

HTTP/2 is widely used, and the attack's potential impact is significant. Several companies, including Alibaba, Apache Tomcat, Apple Swift, and Microsoft, have released updates to counter this new attack vector. Security experts are urging organizations to proactively protect their systems against this vulnerability.

##### Infected Technology
NGINX HTTP/2 module

### Two High-Risk Security Flaws Discovered in Curl Library

##### Description
Two critical security vulnerabilities have been identified in the Curl data transfer library, with the more severe CVE-2023-38545 leading to a heap-based buffer overflow in the SOCKS5 proxy handshake, potentially enabling remote code execution. The issue arises when Curl is asked to transmit a hostname to the SOCKS5 proxy, allowing it to resolve the address, resulting in a buffer overflow if the hostname exceeds 255 bytes. Despite the likelihood of exploitation in the wild, the conditions required for vulnerability are more restrictive, involving triggering code execution through a web app and connection to a SOCKS5 proxy. A less severe vulnerability, CVE-2023-38546, allows unauthorized cookie injection into a program using libcurl, impacting versions 7.9.1 to 8.3.0. Both flaws have been addressed in the recent release of version 8.4.0 on October 11, 2023, ensuring that Curl no longer switches to local resolve mode for overly long hostnames, effectively preventing heap-based buffer overflows. Despite the vulnerabilities, the development team has no immediate plans to migrate Curl to a memory-safe language from its current C framework.


##### Infected Technology
• Curl data transfer library
