### Critical OAuth Flaws Uncovered in Grammarly, Vidio, and Bukalapak Platforms

##### Description
Building on earlier vulnerabilities found in Booking[.]com and Expo, serious security issues have been exposed in the Open Authorization (OAuth) implementation of well-known web services like Grammarly, Vidio, and Bukalapak. Between February and April of 2023, the aforementioned firms responsibly disclosed vulnerabilities that may have given hostile actors access to tokens and possibly even account hijacking. These vulnerabilities have now been fixed. The issue found in Vidio is due to a lack of token verification, which allows an attacker to use an access token obtained for a different App ID—a randomly generated ID that Facebook creates for each website or application that registers through its developer portal.
