### Updates Released by Apple to Fix Zero-Day Vulnerabilities in iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and Safari

##### Description
On Friday, Apple released security updates for several of its products, including iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and Safari, to address two zero-day vulnerabilities that are currently being exploited by attackers. The first vulnerability (CVE-2023-28205) involves a "use after free" issue in WebKit that could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code by sending specifically crafted web content. The second vulnerability (CVE-2023-28206) is an "out-of-bounds write" issue in IOSurfaceAccelerator that could enable an app to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges. Apple has improved memory management and input validation to address the two issues respectively. The tech giant acknowledges that the vulnerabilities "may have been actively exploited" and has withheld further details to prevent more attackers from exploiting them. The updates are available for various Apple devices, including iPhone 8 and later, iPad Pro, Macs running macOS Big Sur, Monterey, and Ventura. These updates mark the third zero-day fix by Apple since the start of the year. Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) and Amnesty International's Security Lab discovered and reported the two vulnerabilities. The recent disclosure by Google TAG reveals that commercial spyware vendors are exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities in Android and iOS to infect mobile devices with surveillance malware.

### Critical Remote Code Execution Vulnerability Discovered in vm2 Sandbox Library by Researchers

##### Description
On April 6, 2023, researchers from KAIST WSP Lab in South Korea discovered a critical flaw in the vm2 JavaScript sandbox module that could be exploited to execute arbitrary shellcode and break out of security boundaries. The flaw affects all versions of the module, including version 3.9.14 and prior. After being notified of the vulnerability, vm2 released version 3.9.15 to address the issue. The vulnerability, identified as CVE-2023-29017, has a CVSS score of 9.8 and is caused by the module's inability to handle errors that occur in asynchronous functions. The vm2 module is a popular library that is widely used to run untrusted code in a secure environment on Node.js. It has almost four million weekly downloads and is utilized in 721 packages. KAIST security researcher Seongil Wi has created two proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits that circumvent the sandbox protections and allow the creation of an empty file named "flag" on the host. It is important for users of the vm2 module to update to the latest version as soon as possible to avoid potential attacks. This is the second critical vulnerability that has been discovered in the vm2 module in recent months. In 2022, vm2 addressed another critical bug (CVE-2022-36067, CVSS score: 10) that could be used to perform arbitrary operations on the underlying machine.
