### New Linux Ransomware Strain BlackSuit Shows Striking Similarities to Royal

##### Description
Named "Blacksuit," this ransomware poses a significant threat to Linux-based servers, cloud infrastructure, and embedded devices. The primary objective of this malware is to encrypt files on infected systems and demand a ransom for their decryption. Blacksuit is believed to be distributed through various means, including malicious email attachments, compromised software downloads, and exploiting vulnerabilities present in Linux systems. Once a system is infected, the ransomware proceeds to encrypt files, rendering them inaccessible to the user. The article warns that Blacksuit has the potential to cause severe disruptions to critical services and organizations relying on Linux infrastructure.
Considering this emerging threat, it is crucial for Linux system administrators and users to remain vigilant and take proactive measures to protect their systems. This includes maintaining up-to-date security patches, implementing robust email filtering and antivirus solutions, regularly backing up important data, and ensuring the use of strong, unique passwords. Additionally, organizations should consider educating their employees about the risks associated with malicious attachments and social engineering techniques to prevent the initial infection vector of Blacksuit and other similar malware strains.

### MOVEit Transfer Under Attack: Zero-Day Vulnerability Actively Being Exploited

##### Description
A critical vulnerability in Progress Software's MOVEit Transfer managed file transfer application is being actively exploited by attackers. The vulnerability, identified as CVE-2023-34362, is an SQL injection flaw that allows unauthorized access to the application's database. The company has released patches for the affected versions. It has been reported that around 2,500 instances of MOVEit Transfer were exposed to the internet, primarily in the United States. Successful exploitation results in the deployment of a web shell to exfiltrate data stored by MOVEit Transfer. The web shell also creates new admin user accounts to avoid detection. Threat actors have been scanning for MOVEit installations, although the specific group behind the attacks is unknown. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has issued an alert and recommends taking mitigation steps. The attacks target file transfer solutions and may involve ransomware groups. CISA has added the vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog. Over 3,000 exposed hosts using MOVEit Transfer have been identified, including those belonging to U.S. government agencies. The attacks have affected various industries in multiple countries. The motivations behind the attacks are unclear, but stolen data may be monetized through extortion or underground forums. Targeting enterprise file transfer systems has been a lucrative strategy for cybercriminals.

### Camaro Dragon Strikes with New TinyNote Backdoor for Intelligence Gathering

##### Description
Chinese nation-state group Camaro Dragon, also known as Mustang Panda, has been linked to a new backdoor called TinyNote, which serves as a first-stage payload for intelligence gathering. The malware demonstrates multiple methods to establish persistence and communicate with servers. Camaro Dragon recently gained attention for the Horse Shell firmware implant, which utilizes TP-Link routers to create a mesh network for covert communications. The group's evasion tactics and targeting techniques have evolved, using a variety of custom tools. TinyNote targets Southeast and East Asian embassies and is the first known Mustang Panda artifact written in Golang. The malware specifically bypasses the Indonesian antivirus solution Smadav. APT41 (Wicked Panda) has been found using living-off-the-land techniques, while Sharp Panda targets high-level government officials in G20 nations through phishing campaigns. The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) uses open-source intelligence for military advantage, leveraging the West's open information environment. Recorded Future warns commercial data providers to exercise caution when selling data to entities in China.

##### Infected Technology
Home Routers, Antivirus solutions, Windows operating system, and email systems

### Chromium Bug Allowed SameSite Cookie Bypass on Android Devices

##### Description
A bug is discovered in the Chromium project that could allow adversaries to bypass SameSite cookie protection feature on Android browsers. The SameSite setting in Chromium is designed to restrict cookie access, preventing them from appearing in HTTP responses when users navigate to a website via a link or redirect request. However, security researcher Axel Chong discovered a bug in Chromium that allowed the bypassing of SameSite cookie protection on Android devices. By using the intent scheme to navigate to a target website, Chong found that SameSite=strict cookies carried over when the web server initiated a redirection with an intent URL. This bypassed the intended security measures of SameSite and the Sec-Fetch-Site header, which are usually used to protect against cross-site request forgery (CSRF). Even normal redirect requests without the intent protocol were affected.

##### Infected Technology
Chromium-based browser on Android devices

##### Source

##### Recommendation
•	Update browser to the latest version on Android devices.
•	Enable experiment cookie feature by entering "chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-cookie-features" in the address bar and enabling the flag.
•	Avoid visiting untrusted websites or following unknown intent URLs that could potentially exploit the SameSite cookie bypass vulnerability.
