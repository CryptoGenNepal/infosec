### Microsoft Uncovers Flaws in ncurses Library Affecting Linux and macOS Systems

##### Description
Memory corruption flaws were found in the ncurses library, affecting Linux and macOS systems. Threat actors could exploit these vulnerabilities through environment variable poisoning to gain elevated privileges and execute malicious code within a program's context. Microsoft, along with Apple, addressed these flaws in April 2023. The vulnerabilities involved manipulating environment variables like TERMINFO to achieve privilege escalation. They encompassed various issues, including a stack information leak, parameterized string type confusion, off-by-one error, and heap out-of-bounds during TERMINFO database parsing, and denial-of-service with canceled strings. While these vulnerabilities had the potential to allow attackers to take control of a program, exploiting memory corruption vulnerabilities necessitated a multi-stage attack, such as chaining the stack information leak for arbitrary read access with the heap overflow for write access.

##### Infected Technology
Ncurses – Programming Library
