### Easily Exploitable Microsoft Visual Studio Bug Opens Developers to Takeover

##### Description
Security researchers from Varonis have discovered a vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2023-28299, in the Microsoft Visual Studio installer that could allow cyber attackers to distribute malicious extensions to application developers. The bug, classified as moderate severity by Microsoft, is easily exploitable and affects multiple versions of Visual Studio, with a 26% market share and over 30,000 customers. Attackers can bypass the security restriction by adding newline characters to the extension name, hiding warnings about the extension not being digitally signed. By delivering a malicious extension, attackers can infiltrate development environments, compromise systems, steal intellectual property, and more. Potential delivery methods include phishing, social engineering, cracked software, or typosquatting in the Microsoft marketplace. User interaction is required for the flaw to be exploited, but all Visual Studio users who are not up to date are at risk. Organizations are urged to update Visual Studio to mitigate the vulnerability.
