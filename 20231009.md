### GoldDigger Android Trojan Targets Banking Apps in Asia Pacific Countries

##### Description
A new Android banking trojan called GoldDigger has been discovered, targeting over 50 Vietnamese financial applications, with potential expansion into the wider APAC region and Spanish-speaking countries.
