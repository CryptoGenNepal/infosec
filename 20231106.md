###  Iran's MuddyWater Espionage Group Adopts Advanced Tactics to Target Israeli Entities


##### Description
In a recent development in the ever-evolving landscape of state-sponsored cyber espionage, Iran's MuddyWater, a known nation-state actor, has launched a spear-phishing campaign with a twist, targeting two Israeli entities. What sets this campaign apart is the use of a new infection vector that deploys a legitimate remote administration tool known as Advanced Monitoring Agent, provided by N-able. Cybersecurity firm Deep Instinct recently disclosed the details of this campaign, shedding light on the group's updated Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs).

MuddyWater is no stranger to the cybersecurity community. This cyber espionage crew, believed to operate under the auspices of Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS), has been active since at least 2017. Over the years, it has been responsible for various campaigns, often utilizing spear-phishing emails with direct links or attachments that lead to the deployment of remote access tools. Previous tools utilized by MuddyWater include ScreenConnect, RemoteUtilities, Syncro, and SimpleHelp.


##### Infected Technology
The spear-phishing campaign targeted Israeli entities, exploiting a multi-stage infection vector that involved the use of a new file-sharing service, Storyblok, to deliver the Advanced Monitoring Agent remote administration tool.
