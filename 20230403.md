### Severe Azure Vulnerability Led to Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution

##### Description
A high-severity vulnerability has been discovered in Microsoft's Azure Service Fabric Explorer. This vulnerability could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on containers hosted on a Service Fabric node. This flaw is tracked as CVE-2023-23383, and it has a CVSS score of 8.2, indicating its high severity. The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue that could lead to the execution of code on containers hosted on a Service Fabric node.The vulnerability is referred to as 'Super FabriXss,' and it resides in a 'Node Name' parameter. This parameter allows an attacker to embed an iframe to retrieve files from a remote server controlled by the attacker. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker could execute a malicious PowerShell reverse shell, allowing them to run code on the container deployed to the cluster. This could potentially lead to system takeover. Both Linux and Windows clusters were found to be vulnerable to the attack.The researchers who discovered the vulnerability observed that modifying a Node name in the user interface is reflected in the Node's independent dashboard. They then crafted a URL and enabled the Cluster Event Type under the Events tab, which allowed them to trigger a JavaScript payload, eventually achieving remote code execution (RCE). Orca Security's proof-of-concept (PoC) uses a URL with an embedded iframe that triggers an upgrade of an Internet Information Services (IIS) application that includes an instruction to download a .bat file containing an encoded reverse shell. The attacker can then use the reverse shell to gain remote access to the application and use it to launch further attacks, access sensitive information, or potentially take over the cluster node hosting the container.To carry out the attack, an attacker could create a custom URL that, when accessed by an authenticated user with appropriate permissions, could instruct the user to enable the Cluster Event Type, triggering the code execution chain. However, Microsoft believes that exploitation of this vulnerability is 'less likely' due to the required user interaction and the complexity of the attack.

### 3CX Supply Chain Attack

##### Description
3CX, a software provider for business communications, was hit by a supply chain attack where attackers compromised its software build pipeline or poisoned an upstream dependency to distribute a malicious version of its app package for Windows and macOS. The attackers utilized DLL side-loading in the Windows version to load a rogue library that could steal sensitive data stored in web browsers, while the macOS version bypassed Apple's notarization checks to download an unknown payload from a command-and-control server. The attack is attributed to Labyrinth Chollima, a North Korea-aligned state-sponsored actor affiliated with the Lazarus Group. 3CX is urging customers to update to version 18.12.422 and use the web app (PWA) version. Google is blocking downloads of the old MSI installer files through its Chrome web browser.

### Russian hacking group Winter Vivern has been actively exploiting Zimbra flaws to steal the emails of NATO and diplomats.

##### Description
A group of hackers known as Winter Vivern (also referred to as TA473) and 
suspected to be aligned with Russian and/or Belarussian geopolitical goals, has 
been actively exploiting a vulnerability in unpatched Zimbra instances (CVE-2022-27926) to gain access to the emails of military, government, and 
diplomatic organizations across Europe involved in the Russia-Ukrainian War. 
The CVE-2022-27926 vulnerability affects Zimbra Collaboration versions 9.0.0 
and is used to host publicly facing webmail portals. TA473 has been targeting 
US elected officials and staffers since February 2023 using bespoke JavaScript 
payloads designed for each government target's webmail portal. The group also 
carries out lateral phishing attacks to infiltrate target organizations. The 
payloads are designed to conduct Cross Site Request Forgery attacks, steal 
usernames and passwords, and store active session and CSRF tokens from 
cookies that allow login to publicly facing vulnerable webmail portals. TA473 
uses scanning tools like Acunetix to identify unpatched webmail platforms used 
by target organizations and sends phishing emails containing malicious URLs 
that exploit known vulnerabilities to execute JavaScript payloads within the 
victim's webmail portals

### Spyware Vendors Exploit Zero and N-Day Vulnerabilities Against Mobile Device

##### Description
Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) recently released a report revealing that two distinct, highly targeted campaigns exploited zero-day vulnerabilities on Android and iOS devices last year. These campaigns were used by commercial spyware vendors, who took advantage of the patch gap between the release of a fix and when it was deployed on the targeted devices. The scale of these two campaigns and the nature of their targets are still unknown. The first campaign, which occurred in November 2022, utilized shortened links over SMS messages to target users in Italy, Malaysia, and Kazakhstan. Clicking on the links would redirect recipients to web pages hosting exploits for Android or iOS, before they were redirected again to legitimate news or shipment-tracking websites. The iOS exploit chain leveraged multiple bugs, including a then-zero-day vulnerability and a pointer authentication code (PAC) bypass, to install an .IPA file onto the susceptible device. The Android exploit chain comprised three exploits to deliver an unspecified payload. While one of these vulnerabilities was patched by Arm in August 2022, it's unknown if the adversary was already in possession of an exploit for the flaw prior to the release of the patch. The second campaign was observed in December 2022, consisting of several zero-day and n-day exploits targeting the latest version of Samsung Internet Browser, with the exploits delivered as one-time links via SMS to devices located in the UAE. The exploits ultimately implanted a C++-based malicious toolkit capable of harvesting data from chat and browser applications. These campaigns highlight the proliferation of dangerous hacking tools in the commercial spyware industry, which poses severe risks to the internet.
