### 40,000+ Fall Victim To SSL Certified Phishing Pages

##### Description
A phishing campaign affected over 40,000 victims in which the scammers used the Salesforce email service to send emails impersonating Facebook. The email directs recipients to click on a phishing link that appears to be from Meta. After clicking the link, victims are taken to a fake website that looks like Facebook or Meta and claims their profile has been marked for questionable conduct and offers an appeal option. The appeal page is equipped with a form where the phishing attack takes place. The page looks legitimate as it has an SSL certification issued by Google Trust Service LLC but is indeed a malicious page made to steal Personally Identifiable Information (PII). The phishing pages in these campaigns also mimicked other well-known brands like Dropbox Business, Microsoft Outlook, and SharePoint, aiming to collect user login credentials. All the phishing pages involved had EmailJS API used by hackers to send information they had gathered, such as complete identities, login email addresses, phone numbers, passwords, and MFA codes.

### Beware of Two Spyware Apps on Google Play: 15 Million Users at Risk 

##### Description
Two file management apps available on the Google Play Store, File Recovery and Data Recovery, and File Manager, have been identified as spyware, potentially jeopardizing the privacy and security of up to 1.5 million Android users. Pradeo, a leading mobile security company, discovered that these apps engage in deceptive behavior by secretly sending sensitive user data to malicious servers in China. Despite claiming on the Google Play Store that no data is collected, Pradeo's investigation revealed that the spyware apps collect various personal information without user consent, including contact lists, media files, real-time location, network details, and device information. The apps also employ advanced techniques to appear more legitimate and difficult to uninstall, such as artificially increasing download numbers and hiding their icons on the home screen. 


##### Infected Technology
Android Devices

### New Linux Kernel 'StackRot' Privilege Escalation Vulnerability

##### Description
Dubbed StackRot security flaw in the Linux kernel that could allow a user to gain elevated privileges on a target host. Dubbed StackRot (CVE-2023-3269, CVSS score: 7.8), the flaw impacts Linux versions 6.1 through 6.4. The flaw is essentially rooted in a data structure called maple tree, which was introduced in Linux kernel 6.1 as a replacement for red-black tree (rbtree) to manage and store virtual memory areas (VMAs), a contiguous range of virtual addresses that could be the contents of a file on disk or the memory a program uses during execution.. Maple nodes are freed using RCU callbacks, delaying the actual memory deallocation until after the RCU grace period. Consequently, exploiting this vulnerability is considered challenging.

##### Infected Technology
• Linux Kernel from 6.1 to 6.4

##### Recommendation
• Use updated version of linux system
