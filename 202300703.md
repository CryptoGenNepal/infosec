### Beware: New 'Rustbucket' Malware Variant Targeting macOS Users

##### Description
Researchers have discovered an updated version of the Apple macOS malware called Rustbucket. This variant, attributed to the North Korean threat actor BlueNoroff, exhibits improved persistence capabilities and employs a dynamic network infrastructure for command-and-control. Rustbucket was initially identified as an AppleScript-based backdoor, capable of retrieving a second-stage payload from a remote server. The second-stage malware, compiled in Swift, downloads the main Rust- based binary from the command-and-control server. A .NET version of Rustbucket with similar features has also been observed. The attacks primarily target finance-related institutions in Asia, Europe, and the U.S., indicating a focus on illicit revenue generation. The malware utilizes a backdoored PDF reader and employs phishing emails and bogus social media profiles for initial intrusion. The newly identified version establishes persistence by creating a plist file and copying the binary to specific paths on the compromised system.

##### Infected Technology
Apple macOS

### New JokerSpy Malware Targets MAC OS

##### Description
A new malware JokerSpy which effects macOS has been found exploiting devices across organizations. Once a device is infected, the malware connects to a C2 server and then proceeds further according to the response from the server. It creates a reverse shell and a backdoor through which the attacker can access the victim’s machine. Various victim device data such as the path to the backdoor python script along with the python version, hostname, username, domain name, OS version etc. are sent periodically to the attacker. Furthermore, within the malware’s construction, a hidden “xcc” binary was also found which contains Mach-O for x86 Intel and ARM M1 architectures. The malware was found to be collecting data related to the victim’s behaviors such as device idle time (last use of keyboard, mousepad etc.), active (frontmost) app, screen status (locked or unlocked), full disk access, screen recoding access and accessibility permission of the active app etc.

##### Infected Technology
Intel and Apple Silicone Macs (x86 Intel and ARM M1 architectures)

### 200,000 WordPress Sites Exposed to Attacks Exploiting Flaw in ‘Ultimate Member’ Plugin

##### Description
Tracked as CVE-2023-3460 (CVSS score of 9.8), the recently identified security defect in Ultimate Member allows attackers to add a new user account to the administrators group. Due to the difference in operation between the plugin and WordPress, attackers were able to trick the plugin into updating metadata keys, including one that stores user role and capabilities, WPScan explains. The company provides indicators of compromise (IoCs) associated with the observed attacks. This has allowed attackers to register user accounts with the administrator role, and at least two site owners have observed and reported the suspicious activity. The plugin’s maintainers, who describe the issue as a privilege escalation bug, have attempted to address it in the last two versions of Ultimate Member, but they have reportedly failed to fully patch it. However, they did acknowledge the ongoing in-the-wild exploitation.
