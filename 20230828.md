### New Telegram Bot "Telekopye" Powering Large-scale Phishing Scams from Russias

##### Description
A malicious Telegram bot is being used by a new financially driven operation to assist threat actors in defrauding their targets.
The toolkit, called Telekopye (a combination of Telegram and kopye, which means "spear" in Russian), works as an automated way to generate a phishing web page from a preset template and transmit the URL to possible victims, who the thieves have given the codename Mammoths.This toolkit is built as a Telegram bot that, when triggered, offers a number of straightforward menus in the form of clickable buttons that can accommodate multiple scammers at once.The earliest version of Telekopye that has been found dates all the way back to 2015, indicating that it has been actively used and maintained for a number of years.Once the payment information has been entered onto the fictitious credit/debit card gateway, it is utilized to steal money from the victim, which is then used to launder money using cryptocurrencies.
Telekopye is completely functional; users may send phishing emails, construct websites, send SMS messages, make QR codes, and produce convincing screenshots and photos of checks and receipts.
To make them more difficult to detect, the phishing domains used to host the pages are registered such that the final URL begins with the anticipated brand name (cdek.id7423[.]ru, olx.id7423[.]ru, and sbazar.id7423[.]ru).

##### Recommendation
• When purchasing used items from internet marketplaces, whenever possible, insist for in-person money and good exchanges.
• Sending money should only be done when you are assured of its destination. Check the website for grammatical problems and graphical inconsistencies before sending money elsewhere.
• If a link appears to be coming from a reliable source, you should still exercise extreme caution when clicking on links in SMS messages or emails.
